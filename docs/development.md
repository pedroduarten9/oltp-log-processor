# Development

This document aims to help the extensibility and development of this service.

## Install

There is a Makefile that should help the extensibility of this service, if you run `make install` it should install tools like cobra to add new commands if needed. If you use other installs, please add there.

## Cobra

To create a new cobra command you should execute `cobra-cli add <command>`
